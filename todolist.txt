finish numpy ntuple production

figure out how many trainings you can fit on one gpu

Check how much the random initialization affects finding the minimum the roc curve.

Try to do the training using different dataset sizes.

Plot the error on the ROC as a function of dataset size and the final loss as a function of dataset size.
